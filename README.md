- 👋 Hi, I’m @franfer98
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames and IA industry
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, just wasting time of my life trying to get a job
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can colaborate in my learning process, i want to learn usefull things and be able to upgrade ppl´s life, besides my own.
- 😄 Pronouns: he...wtf?
- ⚡ Fun fact: University degree doesn´t allways grants you a mean to live, sometimes it is a waste of time, and i dont have an english degree btw xD.
- Languages: Python, CSS, HTML (i know that its not a programming language), C# (a little), and idk, i can learn anything that interest me really fast.
- other languages: Spanish, English (want to learn russian too)
- Despite everything i am a cool guy, just a little too honest sometimes.
